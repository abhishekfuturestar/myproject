Why Use Gabor Filters?
Gabor filters are specialized linear filters used for texture analysis and feature enhancement. They are particularly effective in extracting spatial frequency and orientation information, making them useful for tasks like fingerprint analysis, texture segmentation, and pattern recognition. Gabor filters simulate human visual system responses, enabling fine-grained detection of texture and edges. In this code, Gabor filters are used to enhance specific image features and orientation information.

Key Variables
enh_img:

Represents the enhanced image after applying Gabor filters.
This variable combines information from real (enh_img_real) and imaginary (enh_img_imag) components of Gabor filtering, capturing texture and frequency details in the image.
enh_img_imag:

Represents the imaginary part of the filtered image using the sine component of the Gabor filter.
It helps capture specific textural details, complementing the real part (enh_img_real).
enhance_img:

Refers to the final enhanced output combining all filtering and processing results.
This variable is essential for downstream tasks like segmentation and orientation estimation.
ori_out_1:

Outputs the predicted orientation map of the image, providing critical orientation information (e.g., for fingerprint ridge analysis).
It uses a sigmoid activation to normalize values and is further refined through a peak selection process to identify dominant orientations.
Prediction Outputs
The model predicts several outputs using the main CoarseNet structure:

enh_img, enh_img_imag: Results of Gabor filtering for feature enhancement.
ori_out_1, ori_out_2: Orientation maps used to analyze the image's directional features.
seg_out: Segmentation map for distinguishing relevant regions of the image.
mnt_o_out, mnt_w_out, mnt_h_out, mnt_s_out: Outputs for minutiae orientation, width, height, and strength estimation, essential for detailed fingerprint feature extraction.
Role of Gabor Filters in CoarseNet
Enhancement Phase:

Filters Creation:
filters_cos and filters_sin are Gabor filter banks with cosine and sine components, respectively.
These filters are designed with parameters like stride and wavelength (Lambda) to capture texture details.
Convolution Layers:
filter_img_real applies the cosine component, while filter_img_imag applies the sine component to the input image (img_input).
Outputs are combined to produce enh_img and enh_img_imag, representing enhanced image features.
Orientation Refinement:

Orientation maps (ori_out_1, ori_out_2) are processed to extract the highest peak (ori_peak) corresponding to the dominant orientation in the image.
This is critical for tasks requiring precise directional information.
Integration with Main Network:

Gabor filter outputs (enh_img, enh_img_imag) provide enhanced feature maps that integrate seamlessly with segmentation (seg_out) and orientation estimation (ori_out).
Key Advantages
Texture Analysis:
Gabor filters excel in capturing textures, making them indispensable for fingerprint and pattern recognition tasks.
Feature Enhancement:
Variables like enh_img and enh_img_imag provide a richer representation of the image for subsequent processing.
Orientation Mapping:
Orientation outputs (ori_out_1, ori_out_2) support fine-grained analysis for orientation-sensitive applications.
By combining Gabor filters with the CoarseNet model, this approach enhances the interpretability and effectiveness of the image processing pipeline for texture and orientation analysis.
