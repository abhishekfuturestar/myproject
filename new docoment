Your provided code snippet defines a model called CoarseNetmodel using Keras, and it outputs several values. I'll focus on the outputs you've mentioned: enh_img, enh_img_imag, and potentially enhance_img, as well as why the model is printing multiple outputs.

Key Outputs:
enh_img:

Purpose: It represents the phase of an enhanced image computed using the arctangent of the ratio of two other outputs: enh_img_imag (imaginary part) and enh_img_real (real part).
How It’s Generated:
python
Copy code
enh_img = Lambda(atan2, name='phase_img')([enh_img_imag, enh_img_real])
The atan2 function calculates the phase angle for each pixel based on its imaginary and real parts, often used in signal and image processing.
enh_img_imag:

Purpose: This is the imaginary part of the enhanced image, derived after applying Gabor filters (sinusoidal filters) to the input image. It aids in capturing specific texture or frequency details.
How It’s Generated:
python
Copy code
enh_img_imag = Lambda(reduce_sum, name='enh_img_imag_2')(mul_mask_imag)
This is computed by applying a Gabor filter (imaginary component) to the input image, masking it with the upsampled orientation map, and summing the result.
enh_img_real (not explicitly mentioned but related):

Purpose: The real counterpart of the enhanced image, obtained similarly using Gabor filters but with a cosine-based filter bank.
How It’s Generated:
python
Copy code
enh_img_real = Lambda(reduce_sum, name='enh_img_real_2')(mul_mask_real)
enhance_img:

This variable does not seem explicitly defined in your code. If it is being printed, it might be:
A typo or alias for enh_img.
Defined elsewhere in the broader context of the model or an external script.
A custom modification added to this code.
Printing Multiple Outputs:
The CoarseNetmodel outputs multiple intermediate and final layers because of its design:

If the mode is deploy, the model outputs these specific layers:
python
Copy code
outputs=[enh_img, enh_img_imag, enh_img_real, ori_out_1, ori_out_2, seg_out, mnt_o_out, mnt_w_out, mnt_h_out, mnt_s_out]
This allows the model to provide not just a single prediction but multiple intermediate results useful for debugging, visualization, or further processing.
How It Prints Outputs:
If the function main_net_model.predict(image) is invoked:

It will return all the defined outputs in the list above.
If you are seeing prints, they might be explicitly logged in a script, or the returned outputs might be unpacked as:
python
Copy code
enh_img, enh_img_imag, enhance_img, ori_out_1, ori_out_2, seg_out, mnt_o_out, mnt_w_out, mnt_h_out, mnt_s_out = main_net_model.predict(image)
You might also find debug statements in the script where these values are logged or visualized.
