üìÅ 1. config.json
This file controls general settings related to image processing and display behavior.

Key Sections:
dimensions: Sets display and processing image size.

json

Edit
"display_height": 800,
"display_width": 600,
"processing_height": 800,
"processing_width": 600
These standardize the image dimensions your system uses for consistency.

outputs:

show_image_level: Controls verbosity of image display (e.g., 0 = none, 1 = low, 2 = full).

save_image_level: Same idea but for saving processed images.

save_detections: Whether to save the raw detection results (like bubble positions).

alignment_params:

auto_align: Whether to perform automatic alignment based on a reference image (useful for correcting skewed scans).

üìÅ 2. evaluation.json
This defines how the OMR results are scored and visualized.

Key Sections:
source_type: "csv" ‚Äî Your answer key source is a CSV file.

options:

Path to the CSV (answer_key.csv) and whether to explain scoring per question.

marking_schemes:

json
Copy
Edit
"correct": "1",
"incorrect": "0",
"unmarked": "0"
Defines marks awarded for each scenario.

outputs_configuration:
Enables drawing:

Score (e.g., total marks)

Answers Summary (e.g., correct vs incorrect count)

Verdicts on each question (e.g., colored circles or symbols)

Color scheme for correct/incorrect/unmarked responses.

üìÅ 3. template.json
Defines the layout of the OMR sheet ‚Äî where the bubbles are located and how to interpret them.

Key Sections:
pageDimensions: The size of the OMR sheet in pixels.

bubbleDimensions: Size of each bubble (width x height in pixels).

fieldBlocks: The most important part. Each block defines:

fieldType: E.g., QTYPE_MCQ5 = multiple choice with 5 options (A‚ÄìE).

origin: Top-left corner of the block on the sheet.

fieldLabels: Questions covered in this block.

bubblesGap: Vertical spacing between bubbles.

labelsGap: Vertical spacing between questions.

‚úÖ Example: MCQBlock1 covers Telugu_q1..10 starting at position [85, 322].

preProcessors:

Levels: Adjusts image contrast or thresholds.

FeatureBasedAlignment: Aligns input sheet with a reference (reference.jpeg) using feature matching.

üìÅ 4. answer_key.csv (a.k.a. answer.json in your message)
Contains the correct answers per question. Used to compare with marked responses and assign scores.

üìå Format:

css

Each entry maps a question label (from template.json) to its correct answer. This file powers the evaluation defined in evaluation.json.

File	Role
config.json	Image sizes, display/saving, alignment settings
template.json	Bubble positions, question layout
evaluation.json	Scoring rules, output visualization
